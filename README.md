# scarce2

scarce2 is a rewrite of [Scarce](https://github.com/SiLab-Bonn/Scarce), a software for studies of **s**ilicon **c**h**a**rge **c**ollection **e**fficiencies. It is written in modern python with an educational purpose in mind.

scarce2 is not meant to offer an alternative to precise TCAD simulations, but to explore charge deposition processes in (segmented) planar silicon sensors.
